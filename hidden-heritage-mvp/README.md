# Hidden Heritage | Neural Heritage Interface

> **Status**: v1.0.0 Gold Master (Production Ready)

Hidden Heritage has been reimagined as a **Neural Heritage Interface**—a cognitive, spatial computing platform that treats history as a living signal. It moves beyond traditional web design into an attention-guided narrative experience.

## 🧠 Core Intelligence

### 1. Neural Navigation

- **Contextual Awareness**: The `NavBar` dissolves and reconstructs itself based on user focus, mimicking a heads-up display.
- **Cognitive Flow**: `Home.tsx` uses a "Signal -> Memory -> Exploration" narrative structure, orchestrated by custom neural easing curves (`cubic-bezier(0.2, 0, 0, 1)`).

### 2. Spatial Operating System

- **Holographic Depth**: Site details (`RegionDetail`, `SiteDetail`) float as AR-style HUDs over cinematic backgrounds.
- **Antigravity Engine**: A dedicated WebXR portal (`AntigravityPage`) for 1:1 artifact simulation.

### 3. The "Future Sandstone" Design System

- **Palette**: A calm, intellectual trio of `#F9F7F2` (Sandstone), `#1A1A1A` (Charcoal), and `#C8A359` (Gold).
- **Typography**: Editorial authority via `Playfair Display` and `Inter`.
- **Motion**: Physics-based spring animations for a weightless feel.

### 3. Functional Modules

- **Expedition Booking**: A drag-and-drop itinerary builder.
- **AR Portal**: A WebXR-enabled "Antigravity" experience to view artifacts in 3D.
- **Admin Mission Control**: A dark-mode dashboard for platform analytics.

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React, TypeScript, Vite
- **Styling**: Vanilla CSS (Variables + Utility Classes), Framer Motion
- **3D/AR**: React Three Fiber, @react-three/xr
- **Maps**: React Leaflet
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express (Mock Data / Local API)

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js v18+
- npm v9+

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/hidden-heritage.git
    cd hidden-heritage-mvp
    ```

2.  **Install Frontend Dependencies**

    ```bash
    cd frontend
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Run Development Server**

    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

4.  **Backend (Optional for full flow)**
    ```bash
    cd ../backend
    npm install
    npm run dev
    ```

## 🎨 Design Philosophy

We believe history shouldn't be boring. This project moves away from standard "travel booking" templates to a cinematic, emotional experience. Every pixel is designed to evoke the feeling of discovering a lost treasure.
