## 🌿 Branching Strategy

1.  **Fork** the repository.
2.  Create a **Feature Branch** (`git checkout -b feature/your-feature`).
3.  Ensure code follows the **VisionOS Heritage** design system tokens.
4.  **Commit** using Conventional Commits (`feat:`, `fix:`, `docs:`, `style:`).
5.  Open a **Pull Request**.

## 🖋 Code Standards

- Use **functional components** with Hooks in React.
- Always include **TypeScript types**.
- Adhere to the `index.css` design system variables. Do not use ad-hoc hex colors.
